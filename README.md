<p><span style="font-size: 29px;">
With Noema, you can control the model and choose the path it will follow. 
<br>This framework aims to enable developpers to use **LLM as a though interpretor**, not as a source of truth.

Noema is built on [llamacpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and [guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance)'s shoulders.

# Background:

**Noema is an application of the [*declarative* programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) paradigm to a language model.** 

- [Concept](#Concept)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Features](#features)


## Concept

- **Noesis**: can be seen as the description of a function
- **Noema**: is the representation (step by step) of this description
- **Constitution**: is the process of transformation Noesis->Noema.
- **Subject**: the object producing the Noema via the constitution of the noesis. Here, the LLM.

**Noema**/**Noesis**, **Subject**, and **Constitution** are a pedantic and naive application of concept borrowed from [Husserl's phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl).


## ReAct prompting:
We can use ReAct prompting with LLM.

`ReAct` prompting is a powerful way for guiding a LLM.

### ReAct example:
```You are in a loop of though.
Question: Here is the question 
Reflection: Thinking about the question
Observation: Providing observation about the Reflection
Analysis: Formulating an analysis about your current reflection
Conclusion: Conclude by a synthesis of the reflection.

Question: {user_input}
Reflection:
```

In that case, the LLM will follow the provided steps: `Reflection,Observation,Analysis,Conclusion`

`Thinking about the quesion` is the **Noesis** of `Reflection`

The content *generated* by the LLM corresponding to `Reflection` is the **Noema**.

### Noema let you write python code that automagically:
1. Build the ReAct prompt
2. Let you intercepts (constrained) generations
3. Use it in standard python code

## Features

### Create the Subject

```python
from Noema import *

Subject("path/to/your/model.gguf", verbose=True) # Full Compatibiliy with LLamaCPP.
```

### Create a way of thinking: 

#### 1. Add @Noema decorator to a function/method.
```python
from Noema import *

Subject("../Models/EXAONE-3.5-2.4B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", verbose=True) # Llama cpp model

@Noema
def comment_evaluation(comment):
  pass
```
#### 2. Add a system prompt using the python docstring
```python
from Noema import *

@Noema
def comment_evaluation(comment):
  """
  You are a specialist of comment analysis.
  You always produce a deep analysis of the comment.
  """
```
#### 3. Write python code
```python
from Noema import *

@Noema
def comment_evaluation(comment):
  """
  You are a specialist of comment analysis.
  You always produce a deep analysis of the comment.
  """
  comment_to_analyse = Information(f"{comment}")
  specialists = ["Psychologist", "Product manager", "Satisfaction manager"]
  analyse_by_specialists = {}
  for specialist in specialists:
    analysis = Sentence(f"Analysing the comment as a {specialist}")
    analyse_by_specialists[specialist] = analysis.value
  
  synthesis = Paragraph("Providing a synthesis of the analysis.")
  return synthesis.value, analyse_by_specialists

Subject("../Models/EXAONE-3.5-2.4B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", verbose=True) # Llama cpp model

synthesis, abs = comment_evaluation("This llm is very good at following instructions!")

print(synthesis)
```

<details>
  <summary>LLM output:</summary>
[INST]

You are a specialist of comment analysis.
You always produce a deep analysis of the comment.
  

#COMMENT_TO_ANALYSE : f'{comment}'

#ANALYSIS : f'Analysing the comment as a {specialist}' (Response format: a sentence)

#SYNTHESIS : Providing a synthesis of the analysis. (Response format: a paragraph)

[/INST]

#COMMENT_TO_ANALYSE: This llm is very good!

#ANALYSIS: The comment expresses a positive sentiment towards the LLM's capabilities, suggesting satisfaction with its performance and possibly indicating a belief in its psychological sophistication or understanding of human interaction nuances.

#ANALYSIS: As a product manager, this feedback highlights the importance of user satisfaction and perceived intelligence in LLM evaluations, indicating a focus on enhancing user experience through advanced functionalities and addressing potential psychological aspects beyond mere functionality.

#ANALYSIS: The comment reflects high user satisfaction with the LLM's performance, emphasizing its perceived intelligence and nuanced understanding, which are critical factors for product managers aiming to meet user expectations and foster trust through advanced technological capabilities.

#SYNTHESIS: The comment underscores a significant positive reception of the LLM, highlighting its perceived intelligence and nuanced understanding beyond basic functionality. This feedback is crucial for product managers as it underscores the importance of aligning technological advancements with user expectations for psychological satisfaction and trust-building. Addressing these aspects could enhance user engagement and satisfaction, positioning the LLM as a valuable asset in meeting evolving technological and psychological needs within its applications. Future iterations should focus on maintaining and potentially elevating these perceived qualities to further solidify its role as a sophisticated tool in diverse user contexts.

## Generators
Generators are used to generate content from the subject (LLM) through the noesis (the task description).

Generated value always have 3 properties:
- var_name.value -> The generated value
- var_name.noesis -> The instruction
- var_name.noema -> The generated value

They always produce the corresponding python type.

### Simple Generators

| Noema Type | Python Type  | Usage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Int  | int  | `number = Int("Give me a number between 0 and 10")`  |
| Float  | float  | `number = Float("Give me a number between 0.1 and 0.7")`  |
| Bool  | bool  | `truth:Bool = Bool("Are local LLMs better than online LLMs?")`  |
| Word  | str  | `better = Word("Which instruct LLM is the best?")`  |
| Sentence  | str  | `explaination = Sentence("Explain why")`  |
| Paragraph  | str  | `long_explaination = Paragraph("Give mode details")`  |
| Free  | str  | `unlimited = Free("Speak a lot without control...")`  |


### Composed Generators

List of simple Generators can be built.
| Noema Type | Generator Type  | Usage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ListOf  | [Int]  | `number = ListOf(Int,"Give me a list of number between 0 and 10")`  |
| ListOf  | [Float]  | `number = ListOf(Float,"Give me a list of number between 0.1 and 0.7")`  |
| ListOf  | [Bool]  | `truth_list = ListOf(Bool,"Are local LLMs better than online LLMs, and Mistral better than LLama?")`  |
| ListOf  | [Word]  | `better = ListOf(Word,"List the best instruct LLM")`  |
| ListOf  | [Sentence]  | `explaination = ListOf(Sentence,"Explain step by step why")`  |

### Information

The type Information is useful to insert some context to the LLM at the right time in the reflection process.

| Noema Type | Python Type  | Usage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Information  | str  | `tips = Information("Here you can inject some information in the LLM")`  |

Here we use a simple string, but we can also insert a string from a python function call, do some RAG or any other tasks.


# Advanced:

### SemPy : Semantic python

The SemPy type is creating Python function dynamically and execute it with your parameters.
| Noema Type | Python Type  | Usage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| SemPy  | depending  | `letter_place = SemPy("Find the place of a letter in a word.")("hello world","o")`  |

```python
from Noema import *

@Noema
def simple_task(task, parameters):
    """You are an incredible Python developer.
    Always looking for the best way to write code."""
    task_to_code = Information(f"I want to {task}")
    formulation = Sentence("Reformulate the task to be easily understood by a Python developer.")
    decomposition = ListOf(Sentence,"Decompose the task into smaller sub-tasks.")
    result = SemPy(formulation.value)(parameters) 
    # Generated code:
    #
    # def function_name(word):
    #     letter_counts = {}
    #     for char in word:
    #         if char.isalpha():  # Ensure only letters are counted
    #             char = char.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for uniformity
    #             if char in letter_counts:
    #                 letter_counts[char] += 1
    #             else:
    #                 letter_counts[char] = 1
    #     return letter_counts

    # def noema_func(word):
    #     return function_name(word)

    return result.value 
    
Subject("../Models/EXAONE-3.5-7.8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf",verbose=True)
nb_letter = simple_task("Count the occurence of letters in a word", "strawberry")
print(nb_letter)
# {'s': 1, 't': 1, 'r': 3, 'a': 1, 'w': 1, 'b': 1, 'e': 1, 'y': 1}
```

### Visualization

Enabling reflection visualization with `write_graph = True` in the Subject init create a PlantUML and Mermaid diagram respectively in `diagram.puml` and `diagram.mmd`

```python
from Noema import *


# Create a new Subject
Subject("../Models/granite-3.1-3b-a800m-instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf", verbose=True, write_graph=True)
